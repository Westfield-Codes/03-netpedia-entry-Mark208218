 <h3>The guinea pig or domestic Guinea Pig</h3>
  
             <p> Cavia porcellus, also known as the <strong>cavy</strong> or domestic cavy, 
              is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Cavia, family Caviidae.</p>

 <h4>More about Guinea Pigs</h4>
            <p> 
              Breeders tend to use the name "cavy" for the animal, but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in scientific and laboratory contexts. 
              <br>
             Despite their name, 
             <strong>Guinea Pigs are not native to Guinea
             </strong>, 
             nor are they closely related to pigs. Instead, 
             they originated in the Andes
              <br> 
             region of 
             <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a></em>,
              where wild guinea pigs can still be found today.
              Studies based on 
             <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry">biochemistry</a></em>
              and 
              <strong>DNA</strong> 
             <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)">hybridization</a></em>
              <br>
              suggest they are domesticated animals that do not exist naturally in the wild,
              but are descendants of a closely related cavy species
              <br>
              such as
              <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_guinea_pig">C. tschudii</a></em> 
              . Originally, they were 
            domesticated as livestock (source of meat) in the Andean region and are still consumed 
            <br>
            in some parts of the world.
