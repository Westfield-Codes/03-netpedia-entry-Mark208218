     <h4>More about Twitter and Elon Musk</h4>
            <p> 
              <strong>Twitter</strong> was created in <strong> March 2006</strong> by <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service">Jack Dorsey</a></em>,
               <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Glass">Noah Glass</a></em>, 
               <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biz_Stone">Biz Stone</a></em>, 
               and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)">Evan Williams</a></em>, 
               and was launched in July of that year. 
              <br>
             The service is owned by the American company <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp.">X Corp</a></em>. Which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, 
             Inc. in March 2023 <br>following the <strong>October 2022</strong> acquisition of Twitter by <strong>Elon Musk</strong> for US$44 billion. Musk stated 
             that his goal with the acquisition was to <br>promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition, the platform
              has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation<br> and hate speech.
              <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino">Linda Yaccarino</a></em> succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as the chairman and the chief technology
                officer.<br> In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to "X" and the bird logo would be
                 retired, a process which was completed by May 2024.<br> In March 2025, X Corp. was acquired by xAI, Musk's 
                 artificial intelligence company. The deal, an all-stock transaction, valued X at $33 billion, with a<br> full valuation 
                 of $45 billion when factoring in $12 billion in debt. Meanwhile, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)">xAI</a></em> itself was valued at $80 billion. In 
                 July 2025, Linda Yaccarino <br>stepped down from her role as CEO.
